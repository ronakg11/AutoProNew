The client application requests the 3rd party server its own data, hence no human login and authorization code return is required. The only parameters required in a single step are:
access token URL - E.g. https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token
client_id - An id assigned to the client by Google, to identify the client uniquely
client_secret - Like the client_id's password, to authorize the client on Google's server
scope - Targets specific resource owner endpoint; each unique endpoint denotes specific details the client requires from Google (decided when the client first registers with Google, and depending on what the client needs, Google says - use XX scope endpoint)
grant_type - Static value "client_credentials" denoting the grant type used (this value should be in lower case and words separated by an underscore "_" instead of a space)to (row, col) : (36, 4)
