Answer: Since every test script extends the base class, the parent driver object from the base class was being used for the test execution. This was fine when tests were executed in sequence but turn out to be a problem when tests were run in parallel mode as the driver object was being hijacked & overridden by multiple tests at once, resulting in NoSuchElementException across tests.
Solution: Declare a driver object in every test case and initialize it to the parent driver object from the base class.to (row, col) : (33, 4)
