Solution: Create an object "testThread" of the Java ThreadLocal<ExtentTest> class and store the extent test object in it using "testThread.set(test)" method. Then use "testThread.get()" method instead of the extent test object to log the test status.to (row, col) : (38, 4)

Answer: The extent test object initialized by the first test case was being overridden by other tests running in parallel, and when the first test execution was complete and it tried to log its status using the extent test object (thinking the object belongs to itself), since the object was now tied up to another test, the first test's status was being reported against the test that was now accessing the extent test object. This only happened when tests were run in parallel.

e.g.
1. Tests 1, 2 & 3 are running in parallel.
2. Test 1 completes execution, fails for some reason and on completion, goes to the onTestFailure() method to log its test status.
3. However, the extent test object that it thinks it initialized for itself, has been overridden by test 2 and then test 3 (or test 3 and then test 2).
4. So, unknowingly, test 1 logs the failed status against test 3 (or test 2).to (row, col) : (39, 4)
